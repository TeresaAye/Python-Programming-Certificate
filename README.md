# Python-Programming-Certificate
Certificate from Udacity for Passing Python Programming

I completed the Udacity Python Programming as a prerequisite to taking the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

I was a new python learner at this point.
I've since received / completed the Udacity certificate for the Data Analyst Nanodegree, 
but I'm still learning, and will continue learning and practicing. :)
The other documents are background only.
